# Welcome to ScriptedVestige!  
### Collect all the data, automate all the things.



This is a space to document projects, experiments, and systems I build in my home lab.  Think of it as a behind-the-scenes look at how complex setups come together and how automation can make life easier.



The goal?  To show process, problem-solving, and creativity in action.  I've got some fun and slighty crazy ideas that I'll be documenting here, so grab some popcorn, buckle up, and get ready for a wild ride!
